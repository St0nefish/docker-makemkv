This is a Docker container for [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com).

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the application can be accessed through a
modern web browser, requiring no installation or configuration on the client

A fully automated mode is also available: insert a DVD or Blu-ray disc into an
optical drive and let MakeMKV rips it without any user interaction.

MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

## Quick Start

**NOTE**:
    The Docker command provided in this quick start is an example, and parameters
    should be adjusted to suit your needs.

Launch the MakeMKV docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=makemkv \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/makemkv:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:ro \
    -v /home/user/MakeMKV/output:/output:rw \
    --device /dev/sr0 \
    --device /dev/sg2 \
    jlesage/makemkv
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/makemkv`: Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency.
  - `/home/user`: Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application.
  - `/home/user/MakeMKV/output`: This is where extracted videos are written.
  - `/dev/sr0`: This is the first Linux device file representing the optical drive.
  - `/dev/sg2`: This is the second Linux device file representing the optical drive.

Access the MakeMKV GUI by browsing to `http://your-host-ip:5800`.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
